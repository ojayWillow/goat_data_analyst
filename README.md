## 🚀 THE PLAN

### What You Have NOW (Dec 10)
✅ 8 fully operational agents  
✅ 38 workers following consistent pattern  
✅ 5 core foundation systems (config, logging, error recovery, validation, exceptions)  
✅ 104+ tests all passing  
✅ Works with small-medium datasets  

### What's Missing (To Get to 9.5/10)
❌ Advanced agent features (20+ enhancements)  
❌ Performance optimization for 1M+ rows  
❌ Model explainability (SHAP)  
❌ Hyperparameter tuning  
❌ Production deployment procedures  
❌ Monitoring/alerting setup  
❌ Security hardening  

### The Solution: 4-Week Hardening Plan
📅 **Duration:** Dec 10 - Jan 6, 2026 (4 weeks, 157 hours)  
📋 **See:** `HARDENING_ROADMAP_4WEEKS.md` (detailed day-by-day)  
🎯 **Target:** Enterprise-grade system (9.5/10) production-ready
